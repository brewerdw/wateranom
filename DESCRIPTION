Description: Given a .csv file of global water surplus and deficit return periods,
    the package will create surplus and deficit dataframes that have been manimpulated
    to show the water anomaly return period as a categorical variable.  The package
    creates both water surplus and deficit plots for a specified amount of countries.
    Each plot shows the percentage of the country population exposed water anomalies,
    with different levels of deficits and surpluses.
