Description: Given a .csv file containing a population water anomaly summary 
    showing country water surplus and deficit return periods, the package will 
    create dataframes that have been manimpulated to show the water anomaly 
    return period as a categorical variable.  Using the data frames, the 
    package creates both water surplus and deficit plots for a specified
    amount of countries.  Each plot shows the percentage of the country population
    exposed to water anomalies, with different levels of deficits and surpluses.
