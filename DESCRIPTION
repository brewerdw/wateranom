Description: Given a .csv file of global water surplus and deficit return periods,
    the package will create surplus and deficit dataframes that have been manimpulated
    to show the water anomaly return period as a categorical variable.  Using the data
    frames, the package creates both water surplus and deficit plots for a specified
    amount of countries.  Each plot shows the percentage of the country population
    exposed water anomalies, with different levels of deficits and surpluses.
